# Eleventy + JSX

Example of how to use TSX/JSX with [https://www.11ty.dev](Eleventy).

Usage:

```sh
$ npm i
...
$ npx @11ty/eleventy
Writing _site/README/index.html from ./README.md.
Writing _site/demo/index.html from ./demo.md.
Wrote 2 files in 0.06 seconds (v0.10.0)
```

The code was actually written in TypeScript, but the corresponding JavaScript is
pretty readable, so feel free to read either ;-).
